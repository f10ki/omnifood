Static website for a food delivery company. This is my first website - an educational project.  I only used HTML and CSS, no JavaScript. I used responsive design with media queries. And I successfully have tried to use GIT for the first time.

I'm studying the HTML and CSS course on Udemy.com: Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS. Course created by Jonas Schmedtmann.
